        "Hello survivor. I'm offering a reward for anyone who can help me recover my runes. A few days ago a group of very dangerous magicians stole my magic runes. I know what you're thinking. But whether you believe magic is real or not is irrelevant - the reward is very real. If you're willing to kill a few dark magicians then it's all yours. They're most likely headed to the stone circle out in the far south-east - here, I'll mark it on your map. You'll need to kill all of them, and take the runes from their cold dead corpses. But please, hurry - if they complete the ritual to summon the demon Delrith before you stop them... Livonia is doomed.",
