        "A few months ago we sent our best scout to investigate the contaminated zone down south. We got word that there are military-grade explosives in that area, which are obviously extremely valuable these days. Unfortunately we never heard from our scout again. I think it's safe to assume he's dead. If you're up for it, maybe you and a group of survivors could investigate the zone for me? If you find our scout I'll reward you for the trouble - especially if you recover the explosives.",

        "Sebastian: I figured he was dead. Well done recovering the explosives. You know what, I'd already considered the explosives lost... so why don't you keep them? They might be more effective against our enemies in your hands. Just promise me you'll use them wisely. And hey, take this too - you guys earned it."
