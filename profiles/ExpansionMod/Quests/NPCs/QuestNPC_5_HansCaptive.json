I don't know what they want with me, but I've been here for weeks. Please get me out of here! These bars are made of pure steel, nothing can cut through them - believe me, I've tried. Maybe Sebastian at Sanctuary will have an idea who these guys are? He seems to know everyone in Livonia. The leader of the group wears a yellow helmet with spikes all over it. I bet Sebastian will know who he is. Please hurry!",
